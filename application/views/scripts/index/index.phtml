As new stations appear from time to time and some  unpopular stations get removed, it makes sense to come back regularly to download a new list.</p><p>  You can download data in two formats: an LDB file, which is  <a href="http://locussigilli.blogspot.com/2010/08/making-cycle-hire-easier.html">ready to use with your Nokia Maps</a>  application or a common CSV file you can easily use for your own fun.</p><p>  For example, it is very easy to upload the downloaded CSV into  <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=224843">Google Fusion Tables</a> and then, say, visualise them  on a map in one click.  </p><p>  <a href="#map" id="link_map_show">Please click here to see the sample map</a></p><a name="map"></a><div id="map_container">  <!--  iframe attributes are not CSS'ed as that's a snippet received from Google - let's keep it as is  -->  <iframe border="0" width="500px" height="300px" scrolling="no"  src="http://tables.googlelabs.com/embedviz?viz=MAP&q=select+col0%2Ccol1%2Ccol2+from+224843+&h=false&lat=51.5038274976179&lng=-0.1373291015625&z=12&l=col1"></iframe>  <br/>  <a href="#map" id="link_map_hide">Hide map</a></div>
